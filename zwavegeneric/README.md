# Generic Z-Wave

This plugin adds support for Z-Wave specification compliant devices which don't require manufacturer specific extras. Any certified Z-Wave device should
be supported by this. However, please note that some Z-Wave devices out there either don't follow the specifiction or require manufacturer specific
extra handling in which case they may not work or only work partially with this plugin.

For such devices, please see the manufacturer specific Z-Wave integration plugins.

Installing a manufacturer specific integration plugin will have higher priorty to handle their devices in the nymea system.
